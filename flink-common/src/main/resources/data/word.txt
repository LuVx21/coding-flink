First
a
random
word
length
is
generated
based
on
the
frequency
with
which
any
word
length
from
occurs
in
the
English
language
Letters
are
then
generated
based
on
the
frequency
with
which
they
appear
in
the
English
language
There
are
NO
relative
factors
in
the
calculation
a
one
letter
word
needing
to
be
a
vowel
it
being
impossible
for
the
same
letter
to
appear
or
more
times
in
a
row
or
letters
appearing
more
frequently
next
to
other
letters
This
is
simply
to
demonstrate
the
probability
of
English
words
being
formed
randomly
based
on
their
presence
in
the
English
language
Beneath
the
word
is
its
character
count
and
the
frequency
of
that
word
length
in
the
English
language
Beneath
that
is
the
breakdown
for
each
letter
with
the
frequency
of
that
letter
is
occurance
in
the
English
language
If
you
manage
to
randomly
generate
an
actual
word
be
sure
to
throw
it
in
the
comments
as
it
is
a
fairly
rare
occurance
